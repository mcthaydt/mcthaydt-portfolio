###### **Story**
In the year 2124, during the chaos of World War III, a catastrophic event leads to the destruction of the ozone layer in the stratosphere, which protects the Earth from the sun's harmful ultraviolet rays. As a result, the land and water sources become arid and radioactive, posing a severe threat to human survival.

In response to this crisis, anti-radiation domes are constructed to provide safe living environments for the population. However, the construction and operation of these domes are monopolized by a private company, which demands payment from all the nations of the world in exchange for their services. This company is protected by a paramilitary army, ensuring its dominance over the global population.

Several years pass, and the ozone layer miraculously rebuilds itself; however, this truth is deliberately concealed from humanity by the private company operating the domes. Instead, they use the threat of disabling a nation's dome as a means of blackmail, forcing continued payment: "If you don't pay us, we can turn off your nation's dome."

The protagonist's mission is to uncover this deception and expose the truth about the regenerated ozone layer, ultimately breaking the private company's monopolistic control over the anti-radiation domes and the global population.
